How to do a release (must be on an Ubuntu machine):

Run these commands on a vm:
echo "sun-java6-bin shared/accepted-sun-dlj-v1-1 boolean true" | debconf-set-selections
echo "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/partner.list
echo "deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/partner.list
aptitude update
aptitude install build-essential devscripts debhelper sun-java6-jdk ant1.8 ntp ssh-server


#1. Create a file called build.credentials.properties in the top level project directory.

#2. Add two properties (and fill them in with your google code u/p):
gc.username=
gc.password=

#3. Make changes to the code and commit them.

#4. svn up; ant debian; ant upload

#5. Now, commit the javadoc directory.

#6. Go to http://code.google.com/p/jmxtrans/downloads/list

#7. Click on Summary for the previous version.
